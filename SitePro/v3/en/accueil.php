            I'm Martin Delsart, an engineering student at IMT Nord Europe in Douai since 2019. With a C1 certification in English and a Baccalauréat série S mention Très Bien, I am a polyglot (French C2, English C1, German B1). My internships at Alstom and Decathlon enabled me to contribute to concrete projects, ranging from creating a database for the TGV M to supervising the deployment of a cashiering solution. My digital skills include intermediate proficiency in C programming and database management with Access. Passionate about badminton, music (piano) and a former member of a theater troupe, I'm also involved in community activities, having been a scout and stretcher-bearer at the Lourdes pilgrimage. My diverse background reflects my commitment, versatility and ability to excel in a variety of environments.
